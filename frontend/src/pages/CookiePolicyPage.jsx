      <p>This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are and how BeatPlayr ("us", "we", or "our") uses them on our website (if applicable) and potentially within our mobile application (the "Service"). You should read this policy so you can understand what type of cookies we use, the information we collect using cookies and how that information is used.</p>
      
      <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use an app. They allow the website or app to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you donâ€™t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>

      <h2>How Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
      <p>As BeatPlayr is primarily an offline mobile application, our use of cookies is minimal and typically not within the core app functionality itself. If we have a website for BeatPlayr, it may use cookies for standard website functions.</p>
      
      <h3>Mobile Application (BeatPlayr App):</h3>
      <p>The BeatPlayr mobile application itself <strong>does not use cookies</strong> in the traditional web browser sense. It stores preferences and settings locally on your device, not through cookies that track you across different services.</p>

      <h3>Website (BeatPlayr.app or similar):</h3>
      <p>If we operate a website for BeatPlayr, we may use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> These cookies store information like the number of visitors to the website, the number of unique visitors, which pages of the website have been visited, the source of the visit etc. This data helps us understand and analyze how well the website performs and where it needs improvement. This data is typically anonymized.</li>

        <li><strong>First-party Cookies:</strong> These are set by the website you are visiting.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party Cookies:</strong> These are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting (e.g., Google Analytics).</li>
      </ul>
